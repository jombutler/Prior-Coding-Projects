This project requires that MathWorks' Signal Processing Toolbox is downloaded. This is required for the spectrogram graphing reach feature. Details about the toolbox can be found at this link: https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html.


To download this toolbox, press the "Add-Ons" tab at the top of your workspace after opening MATLAB, then press 
"Get Add-Ons". This will bring you to the Add-On Explorer. From there, enter "Signal Processing Toolbox" and download the add-on labelled "Signal Processing Toolbox" made by MathWorks. This feature was covered by our student license, so it should be free to download with your school account.
